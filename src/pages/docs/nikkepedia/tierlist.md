# tierlist

`/nikkepedia tierlist <character>`

AnisÃ© gives you the ranks of the character in question from 2 tierlists: [nikke.gg's](https://nikke.gg/tier-list/) and [prydwen.gg's](https://www.prydwen.gg/nikke/tier-list) tierlists.

> Nikke.gg's letter ranks may be inaccurate due to lack of information on it; moreover, the colors between the ranks are very indistinct of each other that it is all the more hard to identify. If there's documentation, let me know.
