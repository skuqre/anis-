# Welcome!

Anisé really doesn't have much going for her right now; I just wanted to learn how Astro works with Markdown and now I'm here.

I tried to thoroughly document how the commands work in the code and how would one interact with the commands. I hope it is understandable.

Anisé can currently congregate data from [prydwen.gg](https://prydwen.gg) and [nikke.gg](https://nikke.gg). This whole documentation just explains the commands as they can be needlessly complicated.

Not sure where to begin? Anisé's main features are in the Nikkepedia category. The sidebar to the right displays all of the commands.
