# Getting Started

- When arguments are being presented, they are in a such a format: `<required>`, `[optional]`.<br>**You do not literally type out `<`, `>`, `[`, or `]`.**

- When working with a command's argument with an autocomplete, **I recommend you use the autocompleted argument instead of your own**. Commands will have a 100% chance of success with the autocompleted argument since the commands work based on it.<br>*It's absolute bullcrap, I know, but I had to work with sites that name the same characters differently to each other. With a terrible programmer like me, it's kinda hard to come up with a solution*

This documentation is all the more unfinished, and the bot is in an **alpha** state, missing planned features and bugs all around it.

If you've got a suggestion or something to report, find me in the official NIKKE server. I chat there sometimes as ANISNO1. It's probably the only server that knows where this site can be found, and I have never told anyone this site. Ever.

## Plans

### Technical
| Feature | Ramble |
| --- | --- |
| Logging | Anis√© does NOT have any logging. I see that it's just about standard to have this feature, so why not plan that |
| Fix "The application did not respond" errors | I still don't have the slightest clue what causes this. It always happens in development but not in actual use. |

### Fun
| Feature | Ramble |
| --- | --- |
| Simulation Room | Everyone's favorite bore of a chore! I want to make a command that just straight up lets you play a dumbed down version of the simulation room. |
| Pulling simulator | just like a luck test idk |

### Other
| Feature | Ramble |
| --- | --- |
| Illustration search | Art lookup! I'd like the bot to search for images from PIXIV only. Other imageboards, however, are up to judgement... |

### Moderation
I don't really know *why* you'd need this but uh, sure. Why not I guess.
